Program for Single Cell Calcium Imaging Analysis

This program is a prototype of a data exploration and analysis tool for single cell calcium imaging data. 
It is still in an early stage and while this version is working in our hands for analysis of our specific datasets
with knowledge of its code and limitations it is not yet suitable for general application. 
If a more polished version is available it will be linked here.

Requirements:
This program was written in Python version 3.10 with packages included in anaconda version 23.5.0 
and was only run within spyder version 5.4.3. Only .csv files exported from Trackmate v7.11.1
running in Fiji 2.14 sorted by Frame and Track-ID have been analyzed.
